## Best Practices

### üéØ URL Selection
- **Primary targets**: Main company career pages
- **Secondary targets**: Job board listings
- **Avoid**: News articles, blog posts, general company pages
- **Prioritize**: URLs with career-related keywords

### üîç Extraction Strategy
- **Start with visible content** - Extract obvious job listings first
- **Apply hidden techniques** - Use all 10 techniques systematically
- **Validate results** - Ensure job authenticity and completeness
- **Remove duplicates** - Deduplicate based on job titles and descriptions

### üìä Quality Control
- **Minimum requirements**: Job title and location
- **Preferred data**: Job type, department, level, requirements
- **Validation checks**: Active links, recent postings, complete information
- **Scoring system**: Rate jobs based on completeness and relevance

### üöÄ Performance Optimization
- **Efficient crawling** - Use appropriate timeouts and delays
- **Error handling** - Gracefully handle failed extractions
- **Rate limiting** - Respect website policies and robots.txt
- **Caching** - Cache results to avoid repeated requests

## Example Prompts

### For Career Page Discovery

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **JavaScript-heavy sites**: Use dynamic content loading techniques
